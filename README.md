## Post-Quantum Autonomous Cybersecurity

> “This isn't just the next generation of defense. It's the last generation that will need to adapt.”

### 🚨 A New Cyber Era Begins

**QUANTUM-IR** is not a SIEM. It's not a SOC.  
It’s a **self-evolving security paradigm** powered by quantum intelligence.

It **learns from every attack**, mutates, and improves — just like a quantum neural network.

🧠 **Think:** Quantum cognition. Zero-latency adaptation. Post-quantum resilience.  
🔥 Built for the age of quantum threats and hybrid war.

### 🧩 Core Component: Quantum Oracle Generator

Turn classical detection into **quantum-native logic**.

```python
def sigma_to_qc(sigma_rule: str) -> QuantumCircuit:
    """Convert Sigma detection rules into quantum oracle circuits."""
    # Example: transform "UNION SELECT" pattern into Qiskit gates
    qc = QuantumCircuit(3)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.barrier()
    # Insert pattern-based conditional logic here
    return qc
🔐 From YAML to Qubits: Every attack signature becomes an evolving quantum detector.
🛡️ Your threat rules are no longer static — they're quantum-adaptive.

🚀 Technological Vision
Disruptive urgency in the face of post-quantum threats

No more static signatures — your defense system thinks probabilistically

Fully autonomous cyberbrain that learns, adapts, and counteracts in quantum time
