#QUANTUM-IR: POST-QUANTUM AUTONOMOUS CYBERSECURITY
**The first threat detection system that learns from every attack like a quantum neural network.**
*"It's not a SIEM. It's not a SOC. It's the future of adaptive defense."*

**Quantum Oracle Generator**:
```python
def sigma_to_qc(sigma_rule: str) -> QuantumCircuit:
""Converts Sigma/YAML rules into executable quantum oracles""
# Your code here (transforms "UNION SELECT" into CNOT/Hadamard gates)
